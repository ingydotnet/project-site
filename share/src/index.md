title: My Project Site
description: My project's new web site
---

This new web site was built with the [Project Site](https://project-site.org/) framework.

The Project Site project is about being the simplest way to make a website for each of your projects.
The most basic knowledge of Markdown, YAML, GitHub and running commands in a terminal is all you need.
See [here](https://project-site.org/why-projectsite/) for detailed information.

This web site was built using the same backend builder code as the [Bootstrap Docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/).
